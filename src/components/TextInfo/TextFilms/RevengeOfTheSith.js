        This is the third year of the clone Wars. The galactic Republic, once a
        peaceful and harmonious state, has become a battleground between clone
        armies led by Chancellor Palpatine and droid armadas led by count Dooku,
        the dark Lord of the Sith. The Republic is slowly sinking into darkness.
        Only Jedi knights, defenders of peace and justice, can resist the evil
        that will soon engulf the galaxy. But the real battle is in the soul of
        a young Jedi knight, Anakin, who is torn between his duty as a Jedi and
        his love for his wife, Senator Padma Amidala. And the future of the
        whole world depends on which feeling wins it.
