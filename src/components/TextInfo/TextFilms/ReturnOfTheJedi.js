        In the sixth episode of Star wars, Darth Vader creates a second "Death
        Star". He unites all the forces of evil to use this deadly weapon to
        deliver a final crushing blow to the rebels and their allies. Luke
        Skywalker, along with Princess Leia and the loyal droids R2D2 and C-3PO,
        goes to rescue his friend Han Solo, who was captured by the hideous
        Jabba the Hutt — a powerful ruler of criminals. The rebels land on the
        planet Endor to launch a final attack on the Imperial fleet with Luke
        and His team, an attack on which the fate of the Galaxy depends. In this
        episode, Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader meet for the last time... for
        only one will come out of the fight between father and son alive…
