        The action takes place 10 years after the events described in the first
        episode of the famous Saga. The Republic is sinking deeper and deeper
        into the abyss of contradictions and chaos. The separatist movement,
        represented by hundreds of planets and a powerful Alliance of
        corporations, threatens to become a new threat to the Galaxy, which even
        the Jedi can not cope with. An impending conflict, pre-planned by
        powerful but still undiscovered forces, leads to the beginning of the
        Clonic wars and the end of the Republic. To counter the threat of
        universal proportions, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine seeks to consolidate
        power in the Republic in his hands and orders the creation of a
        Republican army to support a small group of Jedi in their fight against
        a superior enemy.
