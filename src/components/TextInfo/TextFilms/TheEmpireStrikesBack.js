        The struggle for the Galaxy is exacerbated in the fifth episode of the
        space Saga. The Emperor's troops launch a massive attack on the rebels
        and their allies. Han Solo and Princess Leia take refuge in a Cloud
        City, where they are captured by Darth Vader, while Luke Skywalker is on
        the mysterious jungle planet Dagobar. There, Jedi Master Yoda teaches a
        young knight the skills of gaining Power. Luke does not even know how
        soon he will have to use the knowledge of the old Master: ahead of the
        battle with the Emperor's superior forces and a deadly duel with Darth
        Vader.
