        A harsh desert world orbiting twin suns in the galaxy’s Outer Rim,
        Tatooine is a lawless place ruled by Hutt gangsters. Many settlers
        scratch out a living on moisture farms, while spaceport cities such as
        Mos Eisley and Mos Espa serve as home base for smugglers, criminals, and
        other rogues. Tatooine’s many dangers include sandstorms, bands of
        savage Tusken Raiders, and carnivorous krayt dragons. The planet is also
        known for its dangerous Podraces, rampant gambling, and legalized
        slavery. Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker both grew up on Tatooine,
        and Obi-Wan Kenobi spent years in hiding on this desolate world.
