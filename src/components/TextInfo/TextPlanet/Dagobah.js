        Home to Yoda during his final years, Dagobah was a swamp-covered planet
        strong with the Force -- a forgotten world where the wizened Jedi Master
        could escape the notice of Imperial forces. Characterized by its
        bog-like conditions and fetid wetlands, the murky and humid quagmire was
        undeveloped, with no signs of technology. Though it lacked civilization,
        the planet was teeming with life -- from its dense, jungle undergrowth
        to its diverse animal population. Home to a number of fairly common
        reptilian and amphibious creatures, Dagobah also boasted an indigenous
        population of much more massive -- and mysterious -- lifeforms.
        Surrounded by creatures generating the living Force, Yoda learned to
        connect with the deeper cosmic Force and waited for one who might bring
        about the return of the Jedi Order.
