        A city-covered planet, Coruscant is the vibrant heart and capital of the
        galaxy, featuring a diverse mix of citizens and culture. It features
        towering skyscrapers, streams of speeder-filled air traffic, and inner
        levels that stretch far below the worldâ€™s surface. Coruscant was the
        seat of government for the Galactic Republic and the Empire that
        followed, and was the site of numerous historic events during the Clone
        Wars. It also housed the Jedi Temple and Archives, which hosted Jedi
        training and learning for over a thousand generations -- traditions that
        ended when the planet bore witness to Order 66.
