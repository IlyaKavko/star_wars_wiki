        An idyllic world close to the border of the Outer Rim Territories, Naboo
        is inhabited by peaceful humans known as the Naboo, and an indigenous
        species of intelligent amphibians called the Gungans. Naboo's surface
        consists of swampy lakes, rolling plains and green hills. Its population
        centers are beautiful -- Naboo's river cities are filled with classical
        architecture and greenery, while the underwater Gungan settlements are a
        beautiful display of exotic hydrostatic bubble technology.
