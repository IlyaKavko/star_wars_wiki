        If ever one needed an example of the irredeemable evil that was the
        Empire, turn to the shattered remains of Alderaan. An influential world,
        Alderaan was represented in the waning days of the Republic by such
        venerated politicians as Bail Antilles and Bail Organa. A peaceful
        world, Alderaan was bereft of weaponry in an era of galactic strife. It
        was not without spirit, however. Alderaan was one of the earliest
        supporters of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, though its officials
        prudently kept all ties to the Rebellion secret. Despite such
        discretion, the Empire knew it to be a haven of Rebel activity, and
        Grand Moff Tarkin targeted the beautiful world for reprisal as soon as
        the Death Star was operational. The massive primary weapon of the battle
        station obliterated Alderaan, leaving only a lifeless asteroid field
        behind.
