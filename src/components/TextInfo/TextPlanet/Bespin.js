        Secluded from galactic turmoil by its location in a little-visited
        sector of space, Bespin is an astrophysical rarity. An immense gas giant
        surrounded by a number of moons, the planet contains a band of habitable
        atmosphere among its endless clouds. In this stratum of life,
        enterprising prospectors have established floating mining complexes
        devoted to extracting valuable gasses from deep within the planet. The
        most well known of these ventures is the opulent Cloud City, formerly
        under the administration of Lando Calrissian. During the tail end of the
        Galactic Civil War, the Empire garrisoned Bespin and took over Cloud
        City, though the outpost and the planet enjoyed freedom after the defeat
        of the Emperor at the Battle of Endor.
