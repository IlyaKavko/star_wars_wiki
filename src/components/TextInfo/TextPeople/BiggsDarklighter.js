        Biggs Darklighter grew up on Tatooine with Luke Skywalker, and shared
        his friend's dreams of escaping the dull desert world. After graduating
        from the Imperial Academy, he defected from the Empire's service to join
        the Rebellion. He and Luke were reunited at Yavin 4's Rebel base, and
        flew together against the Death Star. Luke returned from that mission as
        a hero, but Biggs did not survive.
