        Owen Lars continued his father Clieggâ€™s efforts to build his homestead
        into a productive farm, working alongside his wife, Beru. Helping with
        the dreary chores required to keep the farm profitable, Owen relied on
        his nephew Luke Skywalker. He could not rein in Luke's drive for
        adventure, though. Young Skywalker longed to leave Tatooine and join the
        Imperial Academy, to live life among the stars. Owen forbade it,
        reminding Luke that he was needed on the moisture farm. Skywalker would
        eventually leave the farm, but under tragic circumstances. Imperials
        searching for missing droids razed the Lars homestead and killed Owen
        and Beru.
