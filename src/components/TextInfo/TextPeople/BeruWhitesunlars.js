        As a young, shy girl, Beru Whitesun's aspirations did not reach beyond
        Tatooine. She was content to marry Owen Lars and lead the tough life of
        a moisture farmer. Beru also fulfilled the role of guardian and
        substitute mother to young Luke Skywalker, and repeatedly voiced her
        support for his dream of joining his friends at the Academy. Beru fell
        victim to the Empire when Imperial stormtroopers raided the family farm
        in search of droids thought to have top-secret plans for the Empire's
        ultimate weapon, the Death Star.
