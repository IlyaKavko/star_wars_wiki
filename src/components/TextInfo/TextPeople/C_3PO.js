        C-3PO longs for more peaceful times, but his continued service to the
        Resistance — and his knowledge of more than seven million forms of
        communication — keeps the worry-prone droid in the frontlines of
        galactic conflict. Programmed for etiquette and protocol, Threepio was
        built by a young Anakin Skywalker, and has been a constant companion to
        astromech R2-D2. Over the years, he was involved in some of the galaxy’s
        most defining moments and thrilling battles. Since the Empire’s defeat,
        C-3PO has served Leia Organa, head of a Resistance spy ring aimed at
        undermining the First Order.
